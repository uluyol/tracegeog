tracegeog is a tool for tracing graphs drawn on world maps, identifying the geographical coordinates of nodes, and exporting the graphs for analysis in other tools.

## Problem

Sometimes while wandering the internet or world of academic papers, you run across network topologies drawn on a map [(example)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-on-july-17-2020/#the-cloudflare-backbone).
Wouldn't it be great if you could trace the topology and run experiments on it?
tracegeog can help.

Note that tracegeog's link tracing is not good. For now you should specify them manually. Fixes are welcome.

See the [data](data) directory for example usage.
